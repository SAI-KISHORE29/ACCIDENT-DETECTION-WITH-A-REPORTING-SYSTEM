# ACCIDENT-DETECTION-WITH-A-REPORTING-SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT
The rapidly growing global population with increasing economic conditions are
leading to significant vehicle growth. The increasing number of vehicles on the
roads has brought about numerous difficulties for Several Authorities. Among the
various issues related to traffic, road accidents are the ones that need attention and
should be on the priority list. In general, emergency services can save many lives by
getting accurate accident sites and rescuing the injured in the shortest possible time.
With this prospect, using Convolutional Neural Network of Deep Learning method
along with python programming language and other necessary tools, it is possible
to accurately locate the scene of an accident and report it quickly to emergency services. 
This project helps to reduce the number of fatalities due to road accidents.
Therefore, by implementing this in real life, the concerned authorities and people
will benefit from the need to save precious human lives.
